/**
 * Moves a company's existing evidence files from one storage backend to another
 * when an admin switches company_settings.evidence_storage_backend.
 *
 * Runs fire-and-forget (like the scheduler): the settings endpoint flips the
 * config, then calls runStorageMigration(companyId) without awaiting. Progress is
 * tracked on company_settings.evidence_storage_migration_status:
 *   'in_progress' -> running (or interrupted by a restart)
 *   'failed'      -> stopped on an error (retryable)
 *   NULL          -> done (or never needed)
 *
 * The *source* backend descriptor + its encrypted credential live in the
 * storage_migrations table for the lifetime of the job, so a migration can be
 * resumed after an API restart with no admin credential re-entry. The *target*
 * side is always the company's current company_settings backend + active
 * company_storage_credentials row.
 *
 * Refs are rewritten per-row, so a partial run is always safe: every row points
 * at whichever backend actually holds its bytes.
