// Server-side mirror of web/src/utils/deptSelfAssessQuestions.js.
//
// self_assessment_submissions.answers only stores {questionId: "YES"|"PARTIAL"|"NO"|"NA"}
// — the question TEXT lives entirely in the frontend catalog. The regulatory-exposure
// AI mapping (mapRegulatoryExposure, aiProvider.js) needs the actual gap/partial
// question text server-side to reason about which provisions are at risk, so this
// file duplicates the catalog + expansion logic rather than inventing a new source of
// truth. KEEP IN SYNC WITH THE WEB FILE — ids and text must match exactly, or a
// department's gap/partial counts here will silently diverge from what the frontend
// shows. (This mirrors the existing departmentQuestions.js / DEPT_QUESTIONS split for
// the onboarding question bank, which has the same constraint.)
