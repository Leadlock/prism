// Per-question remediation guidance for the DPDPA self-assessment readiness
// report. This module is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for the per-gap analysis rendered
// in Annexure G — Gap Remediation Detail and (grouped by `findingKey`) the
// thematic Findings Register.
//
// It is a STATIC dataset: AI-drafted, then human-reviewed. It is NOT a runtime
// AI dependency. The report's deterministic assessment reads `domain`,
// `impact`, `likelihood`, `findingKey`, and the four content fields off each
// entry; the AI layer may only add one optional "in your context" sentence per
// gap on top of this.
//
// RULES
//  - No regulatory provision id / URL / penalty lives here. Provisions come only
//    from the grounded regulatory-exposure mapping (utils/aiProvider.js →
//    provisionIndex.js). See the design spec §5.1 / §5.2.
//  - `findingKey` must exist in FINDINGS (selfAssessmentCrosswalk.js).
//  - `domain` must be a PRIVACY_DOMAINS id.
//  - `gapId` (assigned in readinessAssessment.computeGaps) always equals the
//    submission question id. guidanceFor() may resolve a `${dept}-N` custom
//    question to a shared `generic-N` entry; that never changes the gapId.
//  - Review metadata invariant:
//      ai_draft | needs_revision  → reviewedAt === null && reviewedBy === null
//      reviewed | approved        → reviewedAt !== null && reviewedBy !== null
//    Moving an entry back to needs_revision clears both fields.
//
// Bump GUIDANCE_VERSION on any semantic content change — it feeds the AI cache
// fingerprint (routes/selfAssessment.js resolveNarrative).
