// SOURCE-OF-TRUTH SPLIT (design spec 2026-09-03):
//   • Per-question analysis (why it matters / what good looks like / remediation
//     steps / evidence asks / domain / impact / likelihood) lives in
//     utils/selfAssessQuestionGuidance.js. NOT here.
//   • This file holds only the THEMATIC finding metadata (FINDINGS), the
//     deterministic cross-department CONTRADICTION_RULES, the traceability
//     matrix, the workstream / phasing / policy definitions, and the maturity
//     domain list. No regulatory provision id lives here — regulatoryExposure
//     (aiProvider.js → provisionIndex.js) is the sole source of provisions.
//
// How it is used (utils/readinessAssessment.js):
//   • FINDINGS          — keyed by findingKey. A finding is materialised by
//                         grouping the fired gaps whose guidance.findingKey ===
//                         key (computeFindings). A `synthetic` finding has no
//                         member gap and carries its own impact/likelihood.
//   • CONTRADICTION_RULES — deterministic apparent-tension rules; every `when`
//                         clause must be satisfied by a real submitted answer.
//   • DPDPA_TRACEABILITY — per obligation, a status derived from its trigger
//                         answers, or N/A where `naReason` is set.
